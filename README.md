## Assignment 1 

The code for the [assignment](https://github.com/Jumaruba/TBDA/blob/main/proj1/Enunciado.pdf) can be found at the folder [proj1](https://github.com/Jumaruba/TBDA/tree/main/proj1). The main goal is to create Oracle SQL queries in three different situation: 
- With foreign nd primary keys;
- With indexes;
- Without indexes and FK and PK; 

The difference between the results are justified, using the Oracle databases.

## Assignment 2 

The second [assignment](https://github.com/Jumaruba/TBDA/blob/main/proj2/46-AssignOR-4.pdf) can be found at the folder [proj2](https://github.com/Jumaruba/TBDA/blob/main/proj2/46-AssignOR-4.pdf). The goals of this assignment are: 

- Design an object-relation data model, exploiting the SQL3 extensions;  
- Populate the object relational model with the data in the relational databases;  
- Add some methods that may be useful for some common SQL queries;  
- Execute some queries on the object relation databases;

## Assignment 3  

The third [assignment](https://github.com/Jumaruba/TBDA/blob/main/proj3/docs/67-Assign3-NoSQL2019-v3.pdf) can be found at the folder [proj3](https://github.com/Jumaruba/TBDA/tree/main/proj3).  The goals of this assignment are: 
- Design a Mongo document for the problem and explain the decisions made; 
- Migrate the data from the Oracle into the NoSQL database;   
- Design a Neo4j graph model;  
- Migrate the data from the Oracle into the Neo4j database;   
- Prepare Mongo and Neo4j queries for the questions gave;   
- Compare the Mongo, Neo4j and Oracle implementations from the viewpoints of data size, processing time, and query easiness.
